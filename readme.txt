WooCommerce bulk variations with global price adjustments

== Description ==

Bulk Variations for WooCommerce is a powerful WordPress plugin that simplifies the process of creating and managing product variations in WooCommerce. It allows you to add a new variation attribute to all your existing products with just a few clicks, saving you a significant amount of time and effort. 

Additionally, the plugin offers a global price adjustment feature, enabling you to increase or decrease the prices of the newly created variations with a percentage value.

= Key Features =

* **Bulk Variation Creation**: Create a new variation attribute for all existing WooCommerce products simultaneously. This feature eliminates the need to manually add variations for each product, streamlining the process and saving you valuable time.
* **Global Price Adjustment**: Easily adjust the prices of the newly created variations by specifying a percentage value. You can either increase or decrease the prices across all variations, providing flexibility in your pricing strategy.
* **Landing Page Integration**: The plugin includes a shortcode `[variations attribute="your_attribute"]` that generates a landing page displaying all the available variation terms (e.g., shows, exhibitions) as a grid. Customers can easily navigate and select their desired variation.
* **Automatic Attribute Creation**: If the specified attribute doesn't exist in your WooCommerce installation, the plugin will automatically create it, ensuring a seamless integration with your existing product catalog.
* **User-Friendly Admin Interface**: The plugin provides a clean and intuitive admin interface, allowing you to configure the variation attribute name, variation term name, and pricing adjustment percentage with ease.
