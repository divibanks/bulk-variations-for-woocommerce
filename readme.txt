WooCommerce bulk variations with global price adjustments

== Description ==

This is a simple WooCommerce plugin which allows store owners to use the same stock for multiple attributes (e.g. shows, exhibitions), by creating bulk product variations.

Shows or exhibitions are variations, and they inherit the original price and stock. On top of it, a percentage price adjustment (positive or negative) is possible.
